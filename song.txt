Until the End of the World

Haven't seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold, just passing time
Last time we met it was a low-lit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time
Except you
You were talking about the end of the world

I took the money, I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You led me on with those innocent eyes
You know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You, you were acting like it was the end of the world

In my dream, I was drowning sorrows
But my sorrows they'd learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You, you said you'd wait till the end of the world

Love, love, love, love love love
Love, love, love, love love love
Love, love, love, love love love

About the content
This song is Judas Iscariot singing to Jesus.

The first verse discusses The Last Supper:

    We ate the food, we drank the wine
    Everybody having a good time except you
    You were talking about the end of the world

The second is Judas’s betrayal of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane:

    In the garden I was playing the tart
    I kissed your lips and broke your heart

The third verse is about Judas' suicide after being overwhelmed with guilt and sadness:

    Waves of regret and waves of joy
    I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
    You, you said you’d wait till the end of the world

Some have suggested lead singer Bono also purposefully wove in sexual imagery to keep the song open to interpretation (“Going down on me, spilling over the brim…”).
